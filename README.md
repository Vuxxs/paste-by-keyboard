# Paste by Keyboard

### A simple script for pasting in applications that don't allow clipboard pasting, using your keyboard.

## **How to use**

- Unpack the distribution and run the executable
- Use ``home`` to paste
- Use ``ctrl`` + ``shift`` + ``Q`` to exit
- (optional) Make a shortcut for ```Paste by Keyboard.exe```

You can edit the paste hotkey and the delay in which individual letters are being pasted in settings.ini
